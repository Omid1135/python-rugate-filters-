# python-rugate-filters-
This repository contains Python code for simulating the reflectance spectra of rugate filters with simple sinusoidal and apodized sinusoidal refractive index profiles. It includes calculations, visualizations of refractive index profiles, and plots of reflectance spectra (educational perspective).

This repository provides Python code for simulating the optical properties of rugate filters. Rugate filters are thin-film optical components with continuously varying refractive indices, enabling precise control over their spectral response.   

This project explores two key refractive index profiles:

Simple Sinusoidal: A basic profile with a sinusoidal variation of the refractive index within the film.   
Apodized Sinusoidal: An improved profile that incorporates an apodization function (Gaussian in this case) to reduce side lobes in the reflectance spectrum, resulting in a narrower and more intense peak at the target wavelength.
The code includes:

Calculation of refractive index profiles: Implementation of both simple sinusoidal and apodized sinusoidal profiles.
Simulation of reflectance spectra: Utilizes the tmm library to calculate the reflectance spectra for each profile.
Visualization: Generates plots of both refractive index profiles and corresponding reflectance spectra for comparison.
This project can be used for educational purposes, research, and as a starting point for further exploration and optimization of rugate filter designs."**
